## Security & maintenance

- **Do I need coding experience to use Kano?** No. Kano is built for F&B and micro businesses; you fill in info like a form and Kano generates a professional one-page site.
- **Is my Kano site secure? Does it have SSL?** Yes. All Kano sites (including free) use SSL (https) by default so visitors are protected.
- **If I break something, can I recover?** Yes. Drafts and publish are separate; changes stay in the backend until you publish, and you can always edit and republish.

## Account & login

- **Login failed?** Use URL `kano.site`, close tab, then "Sign in with Google" again
- **Auto-save?** Yes, every 2 seconds; drafts kept 14 days

## Content & design

- **AI not working?** Check AI credits and rate limits
- **Image rules?** JPG/PNG/WebP, max 10MB, &lt;5 uploads/min
- **Brand color?** Hex with # (e.g. #FF5733)

## Features & extensions

- **Is Kano responsive? Will it break on mobile?** Yes, it’s mobile-first. The site adapts on phone, tablet, and desktop so menus and info stay readable.
- **Can I add Google Maps or a booking system?** Yes. You can add Google Business map, Inline booking links, LINE, and more via location modules or custom buttons.
- **Does Kano have membership or subscription features?** Kano focuses on high-conversion one-page sites. There’s no built-in membership system; use custom buttons to link to your member perks, newsletter, or community.

## SEO

- **Rank higher?** Add area + type in tagline, fill image ALT, use AI optimize
- **Clicks but no orders?** Improve CTA copy and use dark button color

## Tracking

- **FB Pixel** — [Settings] > [Tracking], paste Pixel ID
- **GTM** — Paste GTM ID to load tracking codes

## Domain & billing

- **Domain** — You can publish on Kano URL first; Pro supports custom domain
- **Pro** — Custom domain, no watermark, advanced analytics
- **Cancel** — Site runs until period end; data kept; can resubscribe anytime
- **Will my data be deleted when my subscription ends?** No. Content stays in the backend; only the live site goes offline. Resubscribe to Pro to go live again.
- **Can I manage multiple restaurant sites under one account?** Yes. One account can create and manage multiple sites (e.g. multiple brands or locations); advanced features depend on your plan.

## Growth & going live

- **How long until my Kano site is live?** With the 4-step wizard and AI, most users can finish and publish in minutes.
- **How do I upgrade? Is there a refund policy?** Upgrade to Pro anytime from Billing in the dashboard. For payment issues or refunds, contact your Next Kitchen consultant.
