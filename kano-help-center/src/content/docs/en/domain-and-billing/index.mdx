## Domain

You can publish with a **Kano subdomain** (e.g. yourname.kano.site) without buying a domain. Pro supports **custom domains** (e.g. www.yoursite.com).

## Pro plan

- Custom domain
- Remove watermark
- Advanced analytics

## Cancellation

Your site stays online until the end of the billing period, then reverts to free. All content and data are kept; you can resubscribe anytime.
